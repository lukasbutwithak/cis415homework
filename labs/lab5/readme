PROJECT: Lab 5

My version of lab 5 was built on top of lab 4. You run it by typing the following command on the command line:

./a.out 5

You can make ./a.out by typing the following command on the command line:

make

It runs iobound as its command, so an iobound file needs to be included in the directory it is run in.
